          <h4 class="card-title">John Booker Routledge (Chase Stokes)</h4>
          <p class="card-text">age: 17
            <br> eye color: brown
            <br> hair color: brown
            <br> height: 185
            <br> John B grew up as a Pogue on the poor side of Outer Banks, also known as The Cut. John Booker Routledge grew up as an only child and was raised by his father. His mother bailed to Colorado when he was three years old. When John B was 16 his father went missing at sea and is presumed dead, but his body has never been found. John B remains convinced however that his father is still alive. He had been living with his uncle following his father's disappearance, but his uncle left to build houses in Mississippi. John B is the leader of his friend group, The Pogues. This group consists of JJ, who has been John B's best friend since the 3rd grade, Pope, and Kiara. 
            <br> Personality: 
            <br> John B is a loyal and caring friend, he is protective and out-going. He is kind and friendly to most people, although he can be quite rude to the people he despises. He is emotional and gets angry fast, especially when people he cares about are involved. Just like JJ, he normally doesn't have the safest plan as the first option but goes for the more dangerous plan. His main goal is to find his father, which gets him into a lot of trouble. John B is smart, but sometimes he has stupid or weird ideas that don't seem to make sense at all.
