John B remains convinced however that his father is still alive. He had been living with his uncle following his father's disappearance, but his uncle left to build houses in Mississippi. John B is the leader of his friend group, The Pogues. This group consists of JJ, who has been John B's best friend since the 3rd grade, Pope, and Kiara. 
            <p> <h5>personality</h5> </p>
            <br> John B is a loyal and caring friend, he is protective and out-going. He is kind and friendly to most people, although he can be quite rude to the people he despises. He is emotional and gets angry fast, especially when people he cares about are involved. Just like JJ, he normally doesn't have the safest plan as the first option but goes for the more dangerous plan. His main goal is to find his father, which gets him into a lot of trouble. John B is smart, but sometimes he has stupid or weird ideas that don't seem to make sense at all.
