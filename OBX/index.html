                  <li>  <p> John B, JJ, Kiara and Pope make an exciting discovery after a storm: a wreck is the starting point of an exciting adventure. </p>
                  <li>  <p> John B suspects a connection to his father in the clue on the ship. With his friends, he begins to investigate. </p>
                  <li>  <p> The friends want to solve the mystery at any cost, if necessary with the help of illegal tactics. John B confronts Sarah and Pope wants revenge. </p>

                  <li>  <p> John B believes he has made a decisive step forward. Sarah's presence causes tension among the friends. </p>
                  <li>  <p> The search for the gold proves increasingly difficult due to John B's new living situation, a broken friendship and an eerie legend. </p>
                  <li>  <p> JJ tries to improve the friends' financial situation. John B and Sarah grow closer, which makes Sarah's father suspicious. </p>
                  <li>  <p> John B gets behind the truth about his father. He thereby sets events in motion that endanger the treasure hunt. </p>
                  <li>  <p> John B tries to find a way out of the situation. Sarah has to make a decision. </p>
                  <li>  <p> John B and the friends not only have to deal with an increased police presence on the island, but also a big storm endangers their mission. </p>
                </ol>
              <h2> season two </h2>
                <p> John B tries to avoid capture while approaching the gold. But a promise to Sarah could prevent his plans. Back home, his friends have to get used to life without him. </p>

                <p> In a desperate search for help, John B and Sarah end up in a troubling environment. Pope is scheduled to attend a meeting out of town. </p>
                <p> John B and Sarah run out of money and gas, which gets them into trouble. Pope's appointment in Charleston takes a disturbing turn. </p>
                <p> JJ comes up with a plan to help John B. Pope is able to find out more information about the key. Sarah and Kiara each have trouble with their families. </p>
                <p> John B is upset when Sarah meets up with an old flame. Ward's web of lies begins to unravel. Pope gets behind a shocking family secret. </p>
                <p> Sarah's loyalty to John B and the Pogues is put to the test. Jealousies and tempers flare at the annual campfire. </p>
                <p> Armed with new clues, the group can cross dangerous roads and swampland as they try to keep Pope's family secret from falling into the wrong hands. </p>
                <p> The Pogues get to deal with some setbacks: a medical emergency, a nosy neighbour and parental ultimatums. But the group must save the legacy of Pope's family. </p>
                <p> John B, JJ and Kiara prepare for a showdown aboard a ship while Sarah realizes the gravity of her family situation. </p>
